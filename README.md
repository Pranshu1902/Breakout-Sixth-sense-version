# Breakout-Sixth-sense-version

# Welcome to the new version of Breakout or Welcome to the Future: Sixth sense technology

# Forget keyboard. Use your hand gestures to control your board

# By default the game is designed to detect brigth yellow color(like backside of Fevistick) as your controller

# Hold it in your hand and point it at the camera

# You can change the color you want the camera to detect by entering its lower and higher values

# Note- Make sure that there is yellow color in your background. To help you better understand what color the camera is detecting, I have added a red dot that will appear at the center of the yellow object which the camera is able to recognize. Use that to confirm that it is detecting your object and not something from the background.

## Note- I have added a 2 second delay in the beginning so that you can adjust the window size as per you. Don't think that your PC is hanging with my game.

# NOTE- Currently I have set the speed of ball to 5 so that you are able to get used to this game. Once you feel like you have mastered it, increase the speed to 10

# I challenge you to win the game
# Enjoy
